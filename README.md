# MLB Stat Leaders

An MLB batting and pitching stats dashboard, automatically updated via GitHub Actions from the [MLB Stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com).

**🔗 [View the live dashboard](https://almirlimajr97.github.io/mlb_statleaders/)**

## What it is

A terminal-style leaderboard (dark mode, dense, data-driven) with batting and pitching stats covering regular season and playoffs. Data is collected daily and processed into a granular cube by game/situation, enabling advanced filtering without losing context.

### Features

- **Overview** with KPI cards for the current season's leaders (batting: OPS, Hits, Home Runs, RBI; pitching: Innings, OPS against, K%, WHIP)
- **Full tables** for Batters and Pitchers, with traditional columns (AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, BAA) and advanced ones (BB%, K%, WHIP)
- **Granular filters**: season, game type (regular season/playoffs), playoff round, month, team, opponent, venue, batting/pitching side, runners-on situation, home/away
- **Interactive sorting** on any table column
- **Light/dark theme** toggle
- **Performance**: data partitioned by season and lazy-loaded on demand

### Data pipeline

1. **`fetch_data.py`** fetches the play-by-play for every finished game on a given date (regular season and playoffs), saving two row categories per at-bat:
   - `pitch`: the main result of each plate appearance
   - `baserunning`: Caught Stealing, Pickoff, Runner Out, Wild Pitch, and Balk plays captured separately, since they can occur outside the batter's main result

2. **`build_stats.py`** reads the full history in `data/raw/`, deduplicates, calculates outs (including correct baserunning logic), and aggregates into two cubes — batters and pitchers — partitioned by season.

3. **`build_html.py`** reads the aggregates and generates the dashboard: the HTML fetches only the selected season on demand, keeping the initial payload light even with multiple years of history.

The GitHub Actions workflow runs daily, collecting the previous day, re-aggregating the full history, and republishing the site. Manual reprocessing (date range) can be triggered via `workflow_dispatch`.

## Stack

- **Collection & processing**: Python, pandas, requests, PyArrow (Parquet)
- **Front-end**: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework — JetBrains Mono for tabular data, Inter for UI
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

## Built with Claude

This project was built with the help of [Claude](https://claude.ai/), Anthropic's AI assistant — from the data pipeline and aggregation logic to the dashboard design, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.

## Data source

All data comes from the [MLB Stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com), a public, unofficial API. This project is not affiliated with MLB.
